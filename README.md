# 1 Day Chat App

You can find deployed version here https://heuristic-turing-2755b5.netlify.app/ 
This app is made using ReactJS. I have also used Semantic UI for component styling and Apollo client for GraphQL.

## Project Structure

- All the API related queries and mutations is in `api` folder.
- Separate Components are in the `components` folder
- Some data for channel list and users is stored in `data` folder and images in images folder.
- Custom CSS is store in `css` folder. CSS was getting big so I stored here.
- Interfaces and enums are stored in `utils`.

I have improved UI a bit.

## Run Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
